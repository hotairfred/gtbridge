SDC-Connectors Telnet Server - Compatibility Issues
=====================================================
Observed: 2026-02-10
SDC Telnet Server on port 7373
Tested from Linux (Python telnet client)

SUMMARY
-------
The SDC telnet server's DX cluster output has a few issues that cause
compatibility problems with standard DX cluster client software (e.g.
Ham Radio Deluxe, logging programs, and other cluster aggregators).

ISSUE 1: BEL control characters (0x07) appended to spot lines
--------------------------------------------------------------
Spot lines have \x07 (ASCII BEL) characters appended at the end:

  Raw bytes received:
  b'DX de KM7MM:     18101.3  JE6KYA                                      2313Z\x07\x07'

  The two \x07 bytes at the end are non-standard. Standard DX cluster
  servers terminate lines with \r\n only. The BEL characters will cause
  parsers that expect clean text to fail or produce garbled output.

  Fix: Do not append BEL (0x07) characters to spot lines sent to telnet
  clients.

ISSUE 2: Skimmer spotter name format
-------------------------------------
Internal skimmer spots use spotter names like "SKM1-#":

  DX de SKM1-#:   455083.8  XX9XXX         17 dB  30 WPM  CQ            1035Z

  The "#" character in the spotter callsign field is non-standard for
  DX cluster spot format. Many DX cluster parsers expect the spotter
  field to contain only callsign-valid characters (letters, digits,
  forward slash).

  This may cause strict parsers to reject these lines entirely.

  Suggestion: Use a callsign-like format for skimmer spotters, e.g.
  "SKM1-1" instead of "SKM1-#".

ISSUE 3: Test/internal spots visible to telnet clients
------------------------------------------------------
Upon connection, we received what appears to be an internal test spot:

  DX de SKM1-#:   455083.8  XX9XXX         17 dB  30 WPM  CQ            1035Z

  - XX9XXX is not a real callsign (test/placeholder)
  - 455083.8 kHz (455 MHz) is not a standard amateur frequency
  - This appears to be a test/calibration spot from the skimmer

  If these are internal diagnostics, they should not be sent to external
  telnet clients as they will appear as invalid spots.

COMMUNITY REPORTS
-----------------
Other users have reported similar compatibility issues:
- Ham Radio Deluxe cannot display spots from SDC telnet server
- MacLoggerDX has connection/parsing issues
- Common workaround is using Node-Red to reformat the data

WHAT WORKS
----------
The overall telnet protocol implementation is correct:
- TCP connection on configured port works fine
- Login prompt ("Please enter your callsign:") is standard
- Post-login prompt ("WF8Z de SDC Server >") is standard
- Spot line format is mostly standard "DX de" format
- The issues above are relatively minor and easy to fix

WORKAROUND
----------
We wrote a bridge (gtbridge) that strips control characters and handles
the non-standard fields, successfully forwarding SDC spots to GridTracker 2.
